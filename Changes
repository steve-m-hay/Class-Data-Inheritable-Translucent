Revision history for Class-Data-Inheritable-Translucent

1.00  Wed Nov 05 2009
    - Changed mk_translucent() so that when overriding the translucent class
      default value on a sub-class object it doesn't affect the inherited
      translucent class default value still used by other instances of that
      sub-class.  In fact, it was wrong even to install an override unless the
      attribute is actually being overriddeen on the sub-class itself rather
      than on an instance of the sub-class.  (Fixes [cpan #51097].)
    - Changed Makefile.PL to check $ExtUtils::MakeMaker::VERSION before setting
      ABSTRACT_FROM and AUTHOR.
    - Put the NAME content all on one line in the .pm file so that the
      'abstract' is not truncated in the META.yml file.
    - Added LICENSE to Makefile.PL.
    - Removed redundant 'clean' from Makefile.PL so that it doesn't remove the
      tarball when running the 'clean' target after the 'dist' target.
    - Removed all mention of the original author's email address (at his request
      in private correspondence).
