NAME
    Class::Data::Inheritable::Translucent - Inheritable, overridable,
    translucent class data / object attributes

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use base 'Class::Data::Inheritable::Translucent';

      Foo->mk_translucent("bar");
      Foo->bar("baz");

      $obj = Foo->new;

      print $obj->bar; # prints "baz"

      $obj->bar("whatever");

      print $obj->bar; # prints "whatever"
      print Foo->bar;  # prints "baz"

      $obj->bar(undef);

      print $obj->bar; # prints "baz"

DESCRIPTION
    This module is based on Class::Data::Inheritable, and is largely the
    same, except the class data accessors double as translucent object
    attributes.

    Object data, by default, is stored in $obj->{$attribute}. See the
    attrs() method, explained below, on how to change that.

METHODS
    mk_translucent
        Creates inheritable class data / translucent instance attributes

    attrs
        This method is called by the generated accessors and, by default,
        simply returns the object that called it, which should be a hash
        reference for storing object attributes. If your objects are not
        hashrefs, or you wish to store your object attributes in a different
        location, eg. $obj->{attrs}, you should override this method.
        Class::Data::Inheritable::Translucent stores object attributes in
        $obj->attrs()->{$attribute}.
