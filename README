      print $obj->tattr; # prints "baz"
      print Foo->cattr;  # prints "qux"
      print Foo->tattr;  # prints "qux"

      delete $obj->{tattr};
      delete $obj->{oattr};

DESCRIPTION
    This module is based on Class::Data::Inheritable, and is largely the
    same except the class data accessors optionally double as translucent
    object attribute accessors.

    The value of object attribute $attribute, by default, is stored in
    $object->{$attribute}. See the attrs() method, explained below, on how
    to change that.

METHODS
    mk_class_accessor
        Creates an accessor for inheritable, overridable class data. Does
        not install the accessor method if a subroutine of the same name
        already exists; likewise for the alias method
        (_<attribute>_accessor()).

    mk_translucent_accessor
        Creates an accessor for inheritable, overridable class data which
        doubles as a translucent object attribute accessor. Does not install
        the accessor method if a subroutine of the same name already exists;
        likewise for the alias method (_<attribute>_accessor()).

    mk_translucent
        Alias for mk_translucent_accessor(), for backwards compatibility.

    mk_object_accessor
        Creates a non-translucent object attribute accessor. Does not
        install the accessor method if a subroutine of the same name already
        exists; likewise for the alias method (_<attribute>_accessor()).

    attrs
        This method is called by the generated accessors and, by default,
        simply returns the object that called it, which should be a hash
        reference for storing object attributes. If your objects are not
        hashrefs, or you wish to store your object attributes in a different
        location, e.g. $object->{attrs}, then you should override this
        method. Class::Data::Inheritable::Translucent stores the value of
        object attribute $attribute in $object->attrs()->{$attribute}.

COMPATIBILITY
    Before version 2.00 of this module, an object attribute that had been
    set to override translucent class data could be "reset" to reveal the
    inherited class data value by setting it to the undefined value.

    As of version 2.00 of this module, the attribute must now be deleted
    from the object in order to have the same effect. If your objects are
    hashrefs then this is done simply with "delete $object->{$attribute}";
    more generally, and in particular if you have overridden attrs(), this
    is done with "delete $object->attrs()->{$attribute}".

    THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE. EXISTING SOFTWARE THAT USES THIS FEATURE
    WILL NEED TO BE MODIFIED.

SEE ALSO
    * Class::Data::Inheritable - An almost exact duplicate of the
      mk_class_accessor() part of this module, which this module was based
      on.

      However, as of version 0.08, it doesn't make use of Sub::Name (so all
      accessor methods created by it will show up as "__ANON__" in, e.g.
      profiling tools), it doesn't support non hash-based objects, and it
      will blindly overwrite any existing (accessor) methods.

    * Class::Data::Accessor - An almost exact duplicate of the
      mk_translucent_accessor() part of this module, created only a
      fortnight before it!

      However, as of version 0.04004, it also doesn't make use of Sub::Name
      or support non hash-based objects and does overwrite any existing
      methods. It has also been deprecated in favour of
      Class::Accessor::Grouped (or Moose).

    * Class::Accessor::Grouped - The "inherited" accessor type also does the
      same thing as the mk_translucent_accessor() part of this module.

      However, as of version 0.10012, whilst it does make use of Sub::Name,
      it doesn't support non hash-based objects and does overwrite any
      existing methods.
