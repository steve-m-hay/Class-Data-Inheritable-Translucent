    Class::Data::Inheritable::Translucent - Inheritable, overridable,
    translucent class data / object attributes

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;

      Foo->mk_class_accessor(cattr => "bar");
      Foo->mk_translucent_accessor(tattr => "bar");
      Foo->mk_object_accessor(oattr => "bar");

      # Read-only attributes
      Foo->mk_ro_class_accessor(foo => 1);
      Foo->mk_ro_translucent_accessor(bar => 1);
      Foo->mk_ro_object_accessor(baz => 1);

      my $obj = Foo->new;
      print $obj->cattr; # prints "bar"
      print $obj->tattr; # prints "bar"
      print $obj->oattr; # prints "bar"
      print Foo->cattr;  # prints "bar"
      print Foo->tattr;  # prints "bar"

      $obj->cattr("baz");

      print $obj->oattr; # prints "baz"
      print Foo->cattr;  # prints "baz"
      print Foo->tattr;  # prints "bar"

DESCRIPTION
    This module is based on Class::Data::Inheritable; the
    mk_class_accessor() method is largely the same as
    Class::Data::Inheritable's mk_classdata() method, but
    mk_translucent_accessor() creates class data accessors that double as
    translucent object attribute accessors. Accessors for plain object
    attributes can also be created with mk_object_accessor(). Read-only
    accessors for all three types of data/attributes can also be created
    with mk_ro_class_accessor(), mk_ro_translucent_accessor() and
    mk_ro_object_accessor().

    The value of object attribute $attribute, by default, is stored in
    $object->{$attribute}. See the attrs() method on how to change that.

COMPATIBILITY
    Before version 2.00 of this module, an object attribute that had been
    set to override translucent class data could be "reset" to reveal the
    inherited class data value by setting it to the undefined value.

    As of version 2.00 of this module, the attribute must now be deleted
    from the object in order to have the same effect. If your objects are
    hashrefs then this is done simply with "delete $object->{$attribute}";
    more generally, and in particular if you have overridden attrs(), this
    is done with "delete $object->attrs()->{$attribute}".

    THIS IS AN INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE. EXISTING SOFTWARE THAT USES THIS FEATURE
    WILL NEED TO BE MODIFIED.
